Here's a brief description of my Churn Prediction project.


**Title: Churn Prediction in Telecom Data** 

Description: As a Churn Prediction Intern, I focused on identifying at-risk customers within telecom datasets to proactively mitigate customer attrition. 
My responsibilities encompassed the complete machine learning, beginning with data preprocessing. 
This involved handling missing values, identifying and removing unwanted or irrelevant data, and transforming features to ensure data quality and model readiness. 
Subsequently, I trained and evaluated several supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest. 
Through rigorous model selection and hyperparameter tuning, I achieved a strong precision score, demonstrating the models' ability to accurately identify genuine churners while minimizing false positives.

This project provided valuable insights into customer behavior patterns and laid the groundwork for data-driven churn prevention strategies.
